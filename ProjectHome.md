The framework is focused on being simple yet flexible and strives to be as easy to implement as possible.

## Button Features ##
  * The underlying HTML can use either `<button>` or `<a>` elements.
  * They are dynamic and shrink/expand to fit their text labels.
  * There are four states: normal, hover/focus, active, and disabled.
  * The labels can include icons. Use one of the 1000+ included Silk icons or use your own. Icons are specified via HTML class attribute.
  * They use the [sliding doors](http://alistapart.com/articles/slidingdoors/) CSS technique for increased performance.
  * They support different skins by simply changing an HTML class attribute.
  * A layered Photoshop template is provided to assist in creating new skins.
  * Easy to implement.
  * No Javascript required.
